\section{Abstract}
\label{sec:org673c52e}
\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:orga234600}
\section{Methods}
\label{sec:org461de2b}
\subsection{Transcriptomic Workflow Overview}
\label{sec:orgd2cd0a0}

\subsubsection{Quantification}
\label{sec:orgf0e41a5}
The Raw high-throughput RNA-sequencing data from each trial were saved as individual FASTQ files.
The FASTQ files were uploaded to the Galaxy platform (\texttt{usegalaxy.org} ) where the quantifiaction occured.
First, Galaxy's 'FastQC' tool was used to determine the quality of the raw data and to mitigate the effects of amplification bias \texttt{insert settings here}). The Kmer test within 'FastQC' was enabled and set at a length of 7bp.
Following this initial quality-check, the raw files were trimmed with 'Trimmomatic' using its default settings (\texttt{description}).
FastQC was run on the trimmed files to confirm its quality.

After the data was trimmed, transcript abundance quantifiaction was performed by the Galaxy's 'Sailfish quant' tool using the default settings (\texttt{description}).
\subsection{Differential expression analysis}
\label{sec:org71dd47e}
DESeq2(\texttt{Reference}) and EdgeR(\texttt{Reference}) were used to test for differential expression between the legs, body, and pesticide treatment (Deet and Perm). The transcript-level counts were quantified using the TPM (transcripts per million) generated from the 'Sailfish quant' tool. The differentially expressed genes were estimated using an adjusted p value cutoff of less than 0.05 for multiple testing using a false discover rate FDR)   (Benjamini   and   Hochberg,  1995),   and   a   log 2 -fold   change   â‰¥   |2|.
The differential analysis becomes more reliable when the results of the similar tools are compared.
\subsection{WGCNA}
\label{sec:org8b88d21}
\subsection{GO analysis}
\label{sec:org1492adf}
\subsubsection{Blast}
\label{sec:org67be582}
The significantly differentially expressed contigs were searched (BLASTx) against the NCBI \emph{Ixodies scapularis} SwissProt protein database with an expectation value (e-value) of 0.001.
The highest scoring blast hits were assigned a gene ID for each contig.
Fore each search, a positive BLAST hit was functionally profiled using g:Profiler and the PANTHER Classification System.
\subsubsection{GProfiler}
\label{sec:org7926636}
Functional profiling of overrepresented gene sets were statistically listed with enriched terms in gProfiler.
g:GOSt was the g-profiler tool used for functional enrichment analysis.
The GProfiler output is sent to Revigo.
\subsubsection{Revigo}
\label{sec:org70b0d3f}
The R script output of REVIGO (Rudjer Boskovic Institute) generates tree-maps of the genes. These maps show the function of the enriched genes.
\subsubsection{Geneontolyg.org}
\label{sec:orgd728dbd}
The ouptut of blast is sent to Geneontology.org (not sure if this section is needed (didn't use the data at all))
\section{Results}
\label{sec:orgf8494aa}
\subsection{Figure 1: methods comparison between EdgeR and Deseq2}
\label{sec:org1bf6993}
This figure compares the differential expression data from both EdgeR and Deseq2. The P value is small, indicating that EdgeR and Deseq2 have similar results.
