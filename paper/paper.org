*** Quantification
The Raw high-throughput RNA-sequencing data from each trial were saved as individual FASTQ files.
The FASTQ files were uploaded to the Galaxy platform (=usegalaxy.org= ) where the quantifiaction occured.
First, Galaxy's 'FastQC' tool was used to determine the quality of the raw data and to mitigate the effects of amplification bias =insert settings here=). The Kmer test within 'FastQC' was enabled and set at a length of 7bp.
Following this initial quality-check, the raw files were trimmed with 'Trimmomatic' using its default settings (=description=).
FastQC was run on the trimmed files to confirm its quality.

After the data was trimmed, transcript abundance quantifiaction was performed by the Galaxy's 'Sailfish quant' tool using the default settings (=description=).
** Differential expression analysis
DESeq2(=Reference=) and EdgeR(=Reference=) were used to test for differential expression between the legs, body, and pesticide treatment (Deet and Perm).
The differential analysis becomes more reliable when the results of the similar tools are compared.


** WGCNA
** GO analysis
*** Blast

*** GProfiler
functional enrichment analysis. The output from Blast is sent to GProfiler. The GProfiler output is sent to revigo.
*** Revigo
The R script output of Revigo generates tree-maps of the genes.
*** Geneontolyg.org
The ouptut of blast is sent to Geneontology.org
* Results
** Figure 1: methods comparison between EdgeR and Deseq2
This figure compares the expression data that is present in both EdgeR and Deseq2. The P value is small, indicating that EdgeR and Deseq2 have similar results.
#+CAPTION: The quantification files were run through both EdgeR and Deseq2. Each axis plots the expression values as given by its respective title.
