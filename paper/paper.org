* Abstract
* Introduction
* Methods
** RNA-SEQ
*** Quantification
The quant files used for the analysis were the ones generated by the Sailfish quantification tool.
Three other tools were used including the salmon tool, but the results from fastQC were similar enough to
warrant the use of sailfish only. The quant tools were run through the Galaxy system.
*** DESEQ2 Vs EdgeR
The quant files were run through both the DESEQ2 and EdgeR differential gene expression analyzers.
The genes were selected as significant when the log2 fold change of the genes were \(\pm\) 2 and the p value was < 0.01. The results from DESEQ2 are used for the conclusions of this paper.
** WGCNA
** GO analysis
*** Blast

*** GProfiler
functional enrichment analysis. The output from Blast is sent to GProfiler. The GProfiler output is sent to revigo.
*** Revigo
The R script output of Revigo generates tree-maps of the genes.
*** Geneontolyg.org
The ouptut of blast is sent to Geneontology.org
* Results
** Figure 1: methods comparison between EdgeR and Deseq2
This figure compares the expression data that is present in both EdgeR and Deseq2. The P value is small, indicating that EdgeR and Deseq2 have similar results.

** Figure 3: Leg vs Body general (control)
This figure compares the genes up-regulated in the body and leg compared to the total number of genes from the sample.
